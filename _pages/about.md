Biography
======
I'm a PhD candidate of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ([DSAIL](http://dsail.snu.ac.kr/)) in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at the Seoul National University, South Korea. I received B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University, South Korea, in 2017. My research interests involve deep learning applied to computer vision problem, especially **label-efficient learning** such as weakly and semi-supervised learning.
